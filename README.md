# 🚀 **Automated Code Evaluation & Viva Assistance System**

> Empowering hackathon judges to evaluate faster, deeper, and more fairly through intelligent code analysis.

---

## 📌 **Problem Statement**

Hackathon judges must evaluate many team submissions within a very short time.
Manually reviewing each codebase is slow, inconsistent, and often incomplete. Judges struggle with:

* Understanding the overall code structure quickly
* Identifying important or complex parts of the project
* Assessing the team's conceptual understanding
* Preparing meaningful viva questions
* Maintaining fairness and consistency across all teams

These challenges lead to **evaluation fatigue**, biased scoring, and missed insights.

There is a clear need for a system that can **summarize, analyze, and highlight key aspects of a codebase**, enabling judges to **evaluate faster, deeper, and more fairly**.

---

## 💡 **Proposed Solution (Idea Overview)**

We propose an **Automated Code Evaluation & Viva Assistance System** designed to support judges with a structured and intelligent project-review pipeline.

---

### **1️⃣ Submission Intake**

Teams submit a GitHub repository link or a ZIP file.
The system automatically reads the project structure and essential metadata.

---

### **2️⃣ Codebase Understanding**

The system provides a quick, high-level overview of the project, including:

* Files and folder layout
* Code organization patterns
* Documentation quality
* Presence of test scripts
* Basic complexity indicators

This gives judges a **fast and accurate snapshot** of the entire project.

---

### **3️⃣ Concept Analysis**

The system analyzes the implementation to detect:

* Algorithms used
* Data structures
* Logical workflows
* Core functionalities
* Design patterns
* API or service usage

This helps judges understand **what the team actually built** and the depth of their conceptual knowledge.

---

### **4️⃣ Key Insights Extraction**

The system highlights:

* Important or high-impact files
* Complex code segments
* Core implementation strengths
* Areas needing deeper review

This allows judges to focus their time on the **most meaningful parts** of a submission.

---

### **5️⃣ Viva Question Generator**

Based on the code structure and logic, the system generates **precise, targeted viva questions**, such as:

* "Why did you choose this approach?"
* "Explain the logic behind this function."
* "What alternative design would you consider?"

This ensures **quality and consistency** in viva evaluation across all teams.

---

### **6️⃣ Judge Summary Report**

The system produces a compact, judge-friendly summary that includes:

* Project overview
* Key technical insights
* Highlighted strengths and weaknesses
* Auto-generated viva questions

This enables judges to **evaluate projects faster and more fairly**.

---

## 🎯 **Outcome**

A streamlined, evidence-driven evaluation workflow that helps judges:

* ✅ Save significant review time
* ✅ Gain deeper insights into submissions
* ✅ Maintain fairness across all teams
* ✅ Conduct more meaningful viva sessions
* ✅ Rank projects with greater confidence
